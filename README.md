### Features

- Login and Signup: Our user-friendly interface makes it easy for anyone to join. Whether you're a seasoned investor or a first-timer, our platform is designed for you.

- Market Tracking: Keep your finger on the pulse of the startup ecosystem with real-time market data. Know when to hold 'em and when to fold 'em!

- Eldex: Think of it as the Sensex, but for startups. Eldex is our proprietary index, tracking the top 40 startups based on valuation. It's your go-to for a snapshot of the market's health.

- Popular Startups: We highlight trending startups so you can catch the next big wave. Remember when Airbnb was just a place to rent air mattresses? We do!

- Startup Price Charts: Each startup comes with its own price chart, detailing the highs, lows, opens, and closes. You can buy and sell shares just like on a stock exchange.

- ISPO - Initial Startup Public Offering: Similar to IPOs or ICOs, our ISPOs allow you to bid on shares before they hit the market. It's like being a venture capitalist but without the yachtâ€”yet!
